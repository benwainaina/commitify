# Commitify

Commitify is a simple application which is built with Angular
on the frontend and Python on the backend.

The core idea of the project is to allow a user to view
commits on their github repositories.

## Environment Requirements

- Angular version 13
- Typescript 4.4
- Node 12.20.0 or higher

## How to run the application

1. Clone the project.

2. Once you have cloned the project, on your terminal or
   cmd, navigate to the projects folder.

3. Now simply type `npm i` and hit enter. This should install
   the required project dependencies and create a node_modules
   folder.

4. Now, whilst in the folder in step 3 above, simply run
   `npm run start`, and this should automatically open the
   application in your browser.

   If for some reason the application is not opened automatically on your browser, then simply navigate to
   `http://localhost:4200`
